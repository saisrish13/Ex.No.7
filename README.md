# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

# Date:
# Register no. 25017319
# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

PROMPT USED:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule
reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should
interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences
over time."

PROCEDURE:
Define Core Requirements:
- Daily task management
- Smart scheduling
- Wellness tips generation
- Natural interaction
- Adaptation to user preferences
- 
Construct Appropriate Prompts:
- For tasks: 'Remind me to submit the report at 5 PM.'
- For scheduling: 'Do I have free time between 2 PM and 4 PM today?'
- For wellness advice: 'Suggest 3 wellness tips for today.'
- 
Simulate User Interaction:
- Command-line or simple GUI interface to input requests - Responses generated by
ChatGPT using the defined prompts
Adapt Responses:
- Collect feedback to modify prompts and responses
- Optional memory: store user preferences in a JSON or SQLite database
- 
EXPECTED OUTPUT (Example by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
- Daily Task Manager:
- Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM")
- Organize tasks by priority and deadline
- Provide daily summaries and pending items
- Smart Scheduler:
- Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding
- Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots
- Wellness Tips Generator:
- Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks)
- Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses
- 
OBSERVATIONS & ANALYSIS:
Students were able to see how prompt clarity and specificity impact AI responses.
Task management and scheduling features highlighted the importance of structured
prompts.
Wellness tips generation demonstrated the adaptive potential of LLMs. Users
could modify prompts over time to optimize assistant behavior, fostering
creative problem-solving.

CONCLUSION:
The lab exercise successfully created a prototype concept for a personal assistant
powered by large language models. Key outcomes:
- Understanding of tailoring LLM prompts for real-life applications
- Enhancement of creativity by designing personal or academic productivity features
- Application of prompt engineering techniques for optimal AI interaction -
Demonstration of generative AI’s versatility in addressing everyday problems
